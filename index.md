#### Overview
- **Tech Stack:** Python, LangGraph, Streamlit,Ollama
- Implemented a Supervisor-based Multi-Agent Architecture using LangGraph to dynamically route user queries to specialized
agents for resumes, jobs, interviews, and web research.Used TypedDict-based state management to maintain contextual
continuity across multi-turn user interactions
- Built LLM-driven workflows for resume analysis and integrated web search and scraping tools to fetch real-time company and
job-market data.
- Developed a responsive Streamlit UI, enabling seamless interaction between users and the multi-agent system.
